Tinytest, for the ISG Reduction Model

redu-enun-test.wav is a 13-second mono file of speech that includes
times of deliberately clear enunciation and clear reduction.

redu-enun-test.eaf is the reduction labels in Elan Annotation Format,
for ease of visualization in Elan

redu-enun-test.txt is the same information saved as a txt file,
formatted for the convenience of the reduction model.

redu-enun-test.npy is the HuBert features.

redu-enun-test-predictions.npy is the predictions resulting from applying the
model trained on the 5 English annotated files.  These predictions are
not included as an example where the model's predictions are very
accurate; they're not.  But it may be useful to see if the workflow as
you ran it gives the same answe that I got.
