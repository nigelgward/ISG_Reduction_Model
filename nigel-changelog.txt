1. Added the following to __init__.py

# This is here so that relative imports (from the current directory) work okay
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16981921/relative-imports-in-python-3
import os, sys; sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

2. removed the leading dot from
    from .feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor
  at the top of reduction_model.py

3. removed REDUCTION from the path in two places, to get 
     filetxt = open("./default_data/"+file+".txt")
     filenp = open("./default_data/"+file+".npy","br")

4. changed the comment of reduction.predict() to say that it takes in
multiple tracks, and returns predictions for all the tracks

5. added whitespace to reduction_model.py

6. added baby-README.md

7. edited README.md to point to the new location for downloading the
default npy files, to fix typos in the function calls under 3a and 3b,
to improve clarity, and to mention the existence of baby-README.md .

8. added the tinytest folder, with 13 seconds of test data

9. added code to dup the predictions to a csv file

# each frame here is 20 ms, so we write it twice to align with the 
def saveToFile(predictions, filename)
    ofd = open(filename, 'w')
    timepoint = 0.10
    for item in predictions:
       ofd.write(str(timepoint) + str(item) + "\n")	
       timepoint = timepoint + 0.10
       ofd.write(str(timepoint) + str(item) + "\n")	
       timepoint = timepoint + 0.10
